# Proxor-Assignment
A simple Canvas Drawing App.

### Requirements
java 15.0.1 was used in our machine.

## Compiling the program
Open the Terminal in the [src](src/) directory and type
`javac App.java Drawing.java Point.java`
or Simply, `javac *.java` provided there are no
other java files except App, Drawing and Point.
Above command will compile the required src files

## Run the Program
Type `java App` in the same src directory on the terminal.

## App Functionalities
See this document to understand functionalities of this Application.
[Description of Program](Specification/Assignment.pdf "App Specification")

## Testing
Testing was done on sample inputs given in [here](Specification/Assignment.pdf) 
Automated Unit Testing was not possible for me as the methods were declared private to
enable good coding practice. I am still new to Unit Testing using JUnit. Will try to 
figure out a way later. At present I have uploaded the outputs of the program as
screenshot of terminal [here](Testing/Testing.png). Pardon me.
